SYNTAX IS : result = (" + YOUR_CODE_HERE + ");
Anything that compiles in YOUR_CODE_HERE should work.
calculation 3A7 means that x=3, y=7. 
Every operation will consume bout numbers next to it.  
That means that even if you want x^2, you should still write down some y value. 
Priority of operations is- Custom operations first, followed by * and /, followed by + and -.
Negative numbers are sad. ;-;

Examples:

x*x+y

x*1000+y+1

Math.Floor(x/y)

420
